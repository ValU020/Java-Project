# Workshop#2

In workshop#2 we write the requirements and decide to add an option to del/chats or messages, and a call history as a low priority requirements. 
Also, changes were implemented in the classes. Initially each of the following classes was considered a mother class, and upon reviewing the document, the code was restructured to create a mother class from which the other classes were derived. The message class was also eliminated to facilitate code construction.
